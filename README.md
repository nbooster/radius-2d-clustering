# radius-2d-clustering
An efficient parallel algorithm to find the clusters of a big set of 2D points, given a radius, where for each point in a cluster, it's closest neighbor inside the cluster has Euclidean distance from it less than the given radius. This problem is inspired from the stars constellation.
